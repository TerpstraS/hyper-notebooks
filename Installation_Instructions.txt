1. OS: The software is made for Linux systems. Windows is not supported.
However, Windows users can for example install a virtualbox and install
an Ubuntu system inside it.

2. Required software at this point: git, python 3.5 or higher. To install git, for
example see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
For python instructions, for example see 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-1
It is not necessary but may be convenient for advanced users to create and
then activate a virtual environment, see http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

3. Clone the repositories called notebooks and hypercc. For advice on how to
clone a repository see here: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/#platform-linux
There is a third repository called hyper-canny, but it will be installed automatically 
when following the installation instructions below.

4. Install libraries.
For Ubuntu / Debian type:  apt install g++ proj-bin libproj-dev libgeos-dev 
For Fedora type:  dnf install gcc-c++ geos-devel proj-devel

5. Go to the notebooks folder that has been cloned from github. There is
a file called requirements.txt. This can be used to install the required software by typing: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Before using the notebooks, get hypercc from github as mentioned above.
Go into the hypercc folder, and type 
pip3 install --upgrade .

7. One can now use jupyter to open and run a notebook from the folder
notebooks, or use hypercc from the terminal to scan climate model output
from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP5.
